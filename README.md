🎓 Student Lifestyle & Mental Well-Being Analysis
An end-to-end exploratory data analysis project analyzing how lifestyle habits, social factors, and support systems influence student mental well-being and academic performance using self-reported survey data.
The project focuses on data cleaning, EDA, visualization, and human-centered insights, rather than predictive modeling.
🧠 Key Insights
Balanced sleep and moderate study hours reduce mental stress more effectively than extreme effort
Financial stress significantly impacts mental well-being, even when GPA remains stable
Strong family support correlates with healthier coping mechanisms and lower stress
Many highly stressed students do not seek counseling, indicating an awareness or stigma gap
Healthy lifestyle habits (exercise and diet) act as protective factors against stress
At-risk student groups can be identified using combined lifestyle and stress indicators
